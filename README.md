# VM Cost Optimization Analysis
Overview

This project investigates the consumption costs of Virtual Machines (VMs) in a cloud environment and provides actionable insights to reduce costs. By analyzing usage patterns and visualizing key metrics, the project identifies inefficiencies and recommends optimization strategies.

# Key Features

Data Analysis: Examined VM usage data, including CPU, memory, and storage utilization.
Cost Visualization: Created interactive dashboards and visualizations to highlight cost drivers and underutilized resource
Actionable Insights: Provided recommendations to downsize, terminate, or reconfigure VMs for cost savings.

# Technologies Used

Python: For data analysis and visualization.
Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly.
Cloud Platforms: Azure
Visualization Tools: Jupyter Notebooks.

# Results

Identified 50% cost savings by optimizing VM configurations.
Reduced 20% of underutilized resources through actionable recommendations.

# How to Use
